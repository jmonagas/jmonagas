						What website repair and maintenance services are necessary versus
						optional?
					</h2>
					<p className={styles.p}>
						Well, it all depends on your business approach. But we know this for
						a fact: Sooner or later, website owners will require a complete web
						maintenance and repair action plan to update content on their site
						or because of some technical issue. This is the name of the game,
						and therefore an inevitable fact of website ownership.
					</p>
					<p className={styles.p}>
						Although web maintenance and repairs require taking websites offline
						for a few minutes at a time, this could make your regular visitors
						or customers feel inconvenienced and disappointed or worse yet: They
						might even lose their trust, and your business would lose web
						traffic and revenue. You know why? Because your competitors will get
						the clicks, calls and sales.
					</p>
					<p className={styles.p}>
						Website maintenance and repairs seem to be the first and easiest
						item to skip whenever a business owner has a tight budget. Okay, let
						us face it now: Why not just pay for the web design plus hosting,
						and forget about the maintenance unless there is some sort of a
						problem? Why even bother about SEO, ecommerce, social media,
						advertising, and other?
					</p>
					<p className={styles.p}>
						Our pay-for-what-you-have-fixed approach to web maintenance and
						repair allows website owners to manage their costs and tackle the
						work that is strictly necessary versus wasting their money in those
						things that are optional or not required at the moment.
					</p>
					<p className={styles.p}>
						Now, you should also be aware of hackers using sneaky tactics to
						gain access to and compromise your website. You will know this for
						sure if you ever become a victim: After a website has been defaced
						by a malicious third party attack, it is vital to both clean the
						infection and prevent it from happening again.
					</p>
					<p className={styles.p}>
						Next, you will need to audit your site, document how it performs,
						and get recommendations to optimize or develop as required. This is
						where we enter the scene: At Website Repair and Maintenance
						Services, we can diagnose the problems and provide solutions. More
						importantly, we can manage existing websites, or create new ones
						from scratch.
