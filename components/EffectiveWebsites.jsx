						What is the most effective type of website out there?
					</h2>
					<p className={styles.desc}>
						Websites can be pretty much anything. So, this will depend on your
						type of business, or the purpose of your content. You could have,
						for example:
					</p>
					<div className={styles.borders}>
						<p className={styles.p}>
							<b>Personal Website</b>: If you find value in putting your own
							thoughts and opinions online. This category includes a short bio,
							personal blogs, vlogs, and photo diaries.
						</p>
						<p className={styles.p}>
							<b>Portfolio Website</b>: If you want to show potential customers
							the quality of your work, you could use a portfolio website to
							post the best samples of the work done to date.
						</p>
						<p className={styles.p}>
							<b>Infopreneur Website</b>: Infopreneurs usually create and sell
							information products in the form of courses, tutorials, videos or
							eBooks.
						</p>
						<p className={styles.p}>
							<b>Educational Website</b>: Their main goal is to provide
							educational materials to visitors, or information on an
							educational institution.
						</p>
						<p className={styles.p}>
							<b>Brochure Website</b>: A simple brochure website includes just a
							few webpages that lay out the basics of what you do and provide
							your contact information.
						</p>
						<p className={styles.p}>
							<b>Web Portal</b>: They display information in different formats
							from multiple sources, and make all relevant info accessible via
							one single site to those who need it.
						</p>
						<p className={styles.p}>
							<b>Media Website</b>: They include reports and news pieces in
							addition to or instead of content meant purely for public
							entertainment.
						</p>
						<p className={styles.p}>
							<b>Entertainment Website</b>: They are usually visited for
							entertainment purposes, humor, comics, fun or other interesting
							content.
						</p>
						<p className={styles.p}>
							<b>Nonprofit Website</b>: They are the first place many people
							look to learn more about a nonprofit, and determine whether they
							want to support it via donations.
						</p>
						<p className={styles.p}>
							<b>Business Website</b>: Each business out there should have a
							website devoted to branding the types of products or services the
							business offers.
						</p>
						<p className={styles.p}>
							<b>E-Commerce Website</b>: This generally includes a shopping cart
							and a form for customers to enter their credit card info to make a
							purchase online.
						</p>
						<p className={styles.p}>
							<b>Landing Webpage</b>: This is a single page site to collect
							email addresses, signing up to a newsletter, downloading an app,
							or directing visitors to a main website.
						</p>
						<p className={styles.p}>
							So, if you wish to know what the most effective website out there
							is, the most important thing to keep in mind is that your website
							must (a.) answer any questions your visitors or customers may
							have, and (b.) provide a valid method to contact you.
